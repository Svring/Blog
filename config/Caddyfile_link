# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

43.156.28.71:80 {
     # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /srv/Blog/blog/client/build

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    @notProxied {
        not path /api/* /front/* /public/*
    }

    handle @notProxied {
        try_files {path} /index.html
    }

    reverse_proxy /front/* http://localhost:5173 {
        header_up Host {host}
        header_up Connection {header.upgrade}

    }

    handle_path /public/* {
        root * /srv/Blog/blog/server/public
        file_server
    }

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
